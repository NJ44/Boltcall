I was really hesitant to
start a career in sales.
I thought it was too calculated
and aggressive for my personality.
And now I'm making seven figures
a year, doing something I love.
At every single company I've worked
for, I blew my quota out of the water.
No matter the vertical, the size
or the product, I'd do it again
and again and again, because I
was doing something different.
I wasn't manipulative or aggressive.
I was polite.
I had manners.
I really brought
personalization to the table.
I learned the names of our clients dogs.
I thought about their kiddos.
I invested in who they were as humans.
I was focused on relationships.
I've broken 13 sales records.
I was a top sales director at LinkedIn.
I've made more money in the previous
year for the last decade, and I
have no intention of stopping.
My team and I have built an eight figure
business in just a few short years,
based on my technique, which I call
show me, you know, me, because it works.
If you are a salesperson or a sales
leader, this course is for you.
If you're frustrated with your
email open rate or your reply
rate, this course is for you.
You can stand out in a sea of
unoriginal salespeople and get noticed
by some of the best salespeople.
Biggest leads of your life.
I'm Sam McKenna, and I'm going
to teach you how to get anyone
to reply to your cold emails.
I discovered the power of
personalization all the way back in 2010.
I remember when I took my very
first meeting with a C suite.
It was a chief marketing officer at
a law firm called McGuire Woods, and
the gentleman was named Jim Durham.
I was petrified of this first meeting,
but of course he went very easy on me.
And at the end of the meeting,
which I was overly prepared for, he
said, listen, Why don't you do this?
Take a look at my LinkedIn network.
Look at the people that I'm
connected to and see who I know
that you would want to meet.
And then send them an email, tell
them that we know each other.
And I thought, are you kidding?
One of the really interesting parts about
sales is we get those offers a lot and
very few people take that person up on it.
I went back to my office that night.
I looked at Jim's network on
LinkedIn, and I must have sent
over 200 emails to individuals.
But the key that I did, what
was really different, was I used
my subject line strategically.
So in the subject line of the
email that I sent to all these
individuals, I said, from a friend
of Jim Durham's, front and center.
The open rate was off the charts, and
the reply rate was also off the charts.
People were willing to take
meetings with me just because I
was smart to put something in my
subject line that mattered to them.
So it started this realization
of the power of personalization
and the subject line.
And then I started to think,
where else can I use this?
That is where the concept of
show me, you know, me was born.
Show me, you know, me is a phrase I
first heard from one of my mentors.
Over a decade ago.
It's the art of understanding who
your buyers are as people, who their
companies are and what space they're in.
It is so rare that sales reps do
research and come prepared not only
in emails, but also to their calls.
That means the competition for you is low.
The people that are reaching out
to your buyers are not doing show
me, you know me, and that puts
you at a competitive advantage.
In fact, McKinsey says only 8 percent
of companies personalize 8%, but those
who do over 75 percent of them are
seeing an increase in response rates
in meetings, booked and what we are
all fighting for pipeline growth.
I can attest to that.
When we put this into practice with a team
of 22 BDRs, Let me tell you what happened.
This was incredible, and I may have cried
a little bit when we heard the results.
We had 22 BDRs that put Show
Me You Know Me into motion.
Over the course of this period,
what they did was send 500 emails,
about 280 first emails, and the
rest as responses, less than 48
hours after the first one went out.
We got 127 responses
and 41 meetings booked.
Now, if you know anything about averages,
those numbers are through the roof.
Hence why I cried when I heard
the results, but that's one really
great example of how putting
this together for the masses of a
team can really make him talked.
Show me, you know, me has been
so effective at getting replies
that our clients have been lining
up to learn how to do it and how
to teach their teams to do it.
And we took it so far as
to trademark the term.
In this course, I'm going to teach you
how to research your prospects in a
way that's meaningful and not at scale.
I will walk you through the examples
of what show me, you know, me should
and should not look like, and I'm going
to teach you how to write an email
from beginning to end that stands out
even to your highest value prospects.
And finally, we'll talk about the
concept of show me, you know, me and
how it extends beyond quote emails.
How simply building authentic
relationships can help you hit
your quota and take control of
your financial and sales destiny.
I think part of what harms us from a
sales perspective is that somewhere along
the way, we forgot about the customer.
We've designed our processes to be self
serving as companies and as individuals.
How we qualify a meeting, the hoops we
make our buyers jump through in order to
even speak to a sales rep and so forth.
Remember that people want
to be seen as people.
Not just as pocketbooks, not just
as somebody with wallet share.
I think what's so important is
that we make a positive impression
with our very first outreach.
This is where Show Me You Know Me begins.
So for starters, I would encourage
you to go up in the executives
that you're reaching out to.
Don't just reach out to one or two levels
above you, but really reach out to the
most meaningful and sometimes scariest.
Now start to research them,
and my first go to place, of
course, is always LinkedIn.
I'm looking for information about
who they are, not only as an employee
of this company and others, but
also who they are as a human being.
Almost every time I talk
about this concept, reps ask
me, but What do you mean?
Where do I start?
And how much time does this all take?
So I want you to think
about one thing first.
There are three layers to how
we can understand our prospects.
Those three layers are thinking,
again, about the human, the
company, and their space.
The first thing you need to understand
is who your buyer is as a human being.
That means, again, as I just mentioned,
looking at their profiles on LinkedIn.
Start with common connections.
Look in their headline,
look in their about section.
What can we find as common ground
to authentically connect with?
You also want to make sure that
you're then doing your homework
on the prospect as a professional.
What do we know about this human
being at his job or her job?
What do we know about how
long they've been there?
How often they've gotten promoted,
where they worked previously.
Perhaps they had a completely
different career to begin with that
you can authentically tie yourself to.
And finally, check your CRM.
Where has this person showed up,
if at all, in your CRM before?
There is nothing more embarrassing
than getting on a call and saying,
Bill, have you heard of our
product or our company before?
And then Bill kind of cringes and
says, Uh, yeah, I've purchased your
technology six times and I also happen
to sit on your customer advisory board.
We want to make sure that we show
up in a prepared way so that our
clients know we've done our research.
And again, we stand out
now.
I get it.
Sometimes you go to somebody's LinkedIn
profile and there's effectively
a tumbleweed going across it.
There's no information, no picture.
So what are you supposed to do next?
Where does your research begin then?
And what I would tell you
is look into the company.
Go to their website, take a look at
their resources, their press releases,
their values, the principles they have.
Do they raise money for charity?
What is going on with the
organization that you can reference?
More often than not, You'll also
find that the executives have done
podcasts, they speak at conferences,
they write articles, they're part of
press releases directly on the website.
There is so much that you
can pick up from that.
And finally, has this company
been a client of yours before?
Were they a client and they churned,
but now they're coming back?
Is this the 19th opportunity that
you're opening up that you've never
been able to get over the goal
line with this particular client?
This is all information you should know.
And not only is it helpful for you to
be prepared and such an awesome way for
you to stand out, but it's incredibly
helpful for you to know, to qualify,
and to move opportunities forward.
The third layer you want to think
about with getting to know your
buyers, is who they are and the
space that their company is in.
Now, this means the vertical, right?
Thinking about specifically what's tied
to the vernacular of their company.
Do they talk about products?
Do they talk about leads?
Do they talk about professional
services in a different way?
Now, if I go into a law firm, I can't
go in and talk about sales and leads.
I have to use words like clients.
I have to use words like
business development.
So it's really important
that you make that shift.
You might think, what if I have a
territory that has 19 verticals in it?
Am I supposed to memorize them all?
And what I would tell you
is one, maybe eventually.
Not out of the gate.
But first and foremost, think
about what your lowest hanging
fruit is, vertical wise.
Where do you already have
a great footprint and where
can you keep expanding?
Or, where has a new
vertical shown promise?
That you can take and run.
Now, when I think about, again, that
legal example, that's exactly what
I did when I became a sales rep.
I found that we had three or four of
the largest law firms in the world
working with us and none of the others.
So I took it as an opportunity to
interview those individual firms.
understand why they used us, understand
why we were important, learn the
language, and then turn that three or
four into 43 in less than two years.
So we've talked about doing research
on your prospect at the human level,
at the company level, and then
at the space and vertical level.
That can sound like a lot to some sales
reps, but what I always say is just be
realistic that this is a brand new muscle
you are building And it takes time.
Think about how long it might take
you to run a mile out of the gate.
35 minutes?
No, just kidding.
A little bit less.
But every time you try to run
it, you're going to get a little
faster and a little faster.
So give yourself 30 minutes for your
very first Show Me You Know Me email.
I know that seems like an eternity,
but I promise it will speed up.
It will take you less time
each and every time you do it.
And you'll start to get where it's
around five to seven minutes each time.
Just remember, especially when
it comes to high value leads,
quality Always Trump's quantity.

get back to the course.
So here's Sam with the
don'ts of personalization.
I see you live in DC.
Blossoms must be amazing.
Do you want to buy my stuff?
No.
I see you like dogs.
So do I.
Want to buy my stuff?
No.
I see you like to breathe.
I love to breathe.
Do you want to buy my stuff?
No.
Before we move on to putting your research
into an actual email, I want to quickly
touch on a few things you should not
do when it comes to personalization.
I can't tell you how many times I've seen
an email that looks something like this.
Subject line says, Go Knowles.
Now, I went to Florida State, so they're
trying to pull out some Show Me You Know
Me and talk about my alma mater's mascot.
But here's how the email goes.
Hey Sam, saw you went to Florida State.
Go Knolls!
Do you have a problem
at this organization?
And then they go on to try
and pitch me their product.
There is absolutely no authentic tie
to what I do, why they mention the
Knolls, what history they have with it.
That's when I see that
and I go, ugh, not again.
You also want to make sure that you
don't swing too far the other way.
So starting to get into
research that's done on sites.
So perhaps looking at a Yelp review
or a Pinterest board or something
on their Facebook page that's
private and that you happen to find.
So maybe starting a subject line with love
your family beach pictures, or perhaps you
referenced something from a Yelp review
that you saw that they wrote in 2009.
You want to make sure that the show me,
you know me, you reference is either
pulled from their professional LinkedIn
page and has something that they've shared
with their professional network, or Or
that you're pulling it from a company
page, a podcast, or an article that
they wrote that relates to their work.
When you think about the other things
you don't want to do when it comes to
Show Me You Know Me, one of them is
what's called personalization at scale.
I am sure you have seen this
in your inbox, and if not,
your executives certainly have.
It's when you look at a subject
line and it reads in a way that
could be written for that person,
And 500 of their closest friends.
So think about things like quick
question or meeting on Tuesday or
need more pipeline, things that
have no relevance to that person.
And what is called personalization
at scale is what we want to avoid.
Now I see this kind of email all the time.
Hi, Kimberly, I found your profile on
LinkedIn and I wanted to reach out.
This is a prime example of
what we don't want to do.
I want you to think about
these two things together.
The subject line and the first sentence
are what's called your preview text.
And what you're going to see is
that particular executive has gotten
that email, and 30 just like it.
There's nothing that helps it stand
out and cut through the noise.
Further, when you think about
something like this in that preview
text, it's what that person sees
before they even open up the email.
And it says, Psst, Psst, Psst.
This is a sales email, so it
encourages them not to even open
it, but to automatically delete it.
This kind of personalization
at scale is not effective.
It doesn't relate to who this person is
as an individual, and it shows that we
didn't actually make any sort of effort.
Here's another example.
If you look at the subject line, it says,
if you're struggling with budget cuts.
So we just shortcut to exactly what
the value prop is of the email.
And we simply say, Hey, this is
a sales email front and center.
Now, one last example.
This could be one of my favorites simply
because there's so much to pull apart.
But let's look at a couple of things.
First of all, it talks
about poverty alleviation.
If you look at my profile or if you look
at our website, you'll see that we do
raise money for poverty alleviation.
We're really passionate about it.
So it could be a great show.
Me, you know, me, except it says nothing
about how it relates back to them.
It simply asks me a little bit of an
awkward question about how I got into it.
I guess we got into it just by
being good humans, but I digress.
Look at the rest of the email.
First and foremost, it separates
out our company name, SAM Sales,
and that's not our company name.
Another thing to think about is that
they talk about the massive rise in
consultancies in the District of Columbia.
What does that mean?
They're trying to pull something that
relates to my business and relates to my
location with absolutely no point, right?
Really important that we make sure
that whatever piece of personalization
we put in is authentically tied
back to us and has a great point.
So my point in all of this is
that poor personalization can
truly do more harm than good.
Being inauthentic, getting too
personal, or relying too much on
personalization at scale will showcase
that you didn't do your homework,
and showcases that potentially time
with you will not be well spent.
There's a hobby balance you
want to strike, and a way to
write emails that sound human.
Sound authentic and truly add value.
I'll show you how to write
those kinds of emails next.
The industry average open rate for
emails is alarmingly around 6%.
And if you want to be even more
terrified, their average reply rate is 0.
9%, not even a full percentage point.
When you compare that to Show Me, You Know
Me open rates, here's what we look like.
An average open of 43 percent
and an average reply rate of 20%.
That's incredible.
And it's unheard of in the sales
world, which is unfortunate,
but also not so unfortunate.
Because what that means for you is there's
a massive opportunity for you to stand
out in executives inboxes simply by
putting some thought into what you write.
Let me show you what an executive's
inbox usually looks like.
It's not pretty, right?
Available to talk?
Can I make an intro?
Quick introductions?
Quick question?
There's so many subject
lines that are all generic.
They say personalization at scale
and they secretly say, psst,
I want to sell you something.
You can do so much better than
this and you've got to do better
than this if you expect anyone to
open, read and reply to your email.
Now let's get into exactly
how you're going to do this.
The subject line is the most
important part of your email.
This is where you have just a few
seconds to capture the attention
of the CEO, VP, or whatever
executive you're reaching out to.
The subject line could
look something like this.
Now, when you read the subject line,
I want you to again reflect, does this
subject line make any sense to you?
If you say no, then we
did our job correctly.
This email was written specifically
for the Chief Logistics Officer of Tory
Burch, a multi billion dollar company.
And here's what happened.
In less than 10 hours of that very first
email being sent, the person responded
and they said, your email stood out in a
sea of emails that I get every single day.
Now, here's a really cool thing
about this subject line as well.
This is where you can start to scale this.
What other executives do you have
that were in that same fraternity?
Think about how this is a great
opportunity to use that same subject
line and to use it on multiple
executives while still making it
look like it was just for them.
A couple of other tips.
Think about how to break
up your subject line.
Shorter is not necessarily better.
You don't have to adhere to less
than four words, and you can use
plus signs as a great way to break
up the verbiage in your subject line.
Referencing those exact tips,
here's an example of a subject
line that would work on me.
Switzerland, plus Le Dip
cheeseburger, plus your company name.
I want you to think
about this subject line.
Again, it makes absolutely no sense to
you, and it makes absolutely no sense
to anybody that you know, except for me.
I'm originally from Switzerland.
I was born just outside Geneva.
I live in Washington, D.
C., and I often whacks poetic about
the cheeseburger a la diplomat.
And your company name doesn't make any
sense to me, but the first two things do.
So it's at least going to get me to open
up the email and see what it is that
you have to say about the incredible
show me you know me that you did on me.
The second most important part of
your email is the first sentence.
Your subject line plus your first
sentence is what's known as the
preview text, and that's primarily what
determines if your email gets read.
There are two different approaches
that I'd recommend trying here.
At my company, Sam Sales, our
go to first sentence is this.
Hi, Bill.
We have yet to be properly
introduced, but I'm Sam McKenna,
and Now, a couple things here.
A lot of people will say not to
introduce yourself in the first sentence.
It's a waste of space, they say.
But here's where I differ in opinion.
When you put together a subject line
that shows that person that you know
them and you've done research, and
you pair it with, we have yet to
be properly introduced, what you're
signaling to somebody is that perhaps
we should have been introduced, and
that you do know something about them.
Now another example is to go right
into the show me you know me.
Don't waste any time.
You might say something about their dog in
the subject line, and then say something
like this in your first sentence.
Bill, I saw your recent post about your
adorable furry companion Sprinkles and,
and then tie it back to your own dog.
You'll see some of the most high level
executives often post about their dog.
So a great way to open up the door
with them is to reference those
animals and again, to think about
an authentic tie right back to you.
Your value proposition is not what you do.
Most emails that we see
say what the person does.
Now that's a marketing email.
So your value proposition is truly
the challenge that you solve.
What is it that you do for that particular
buyer and how can you help them?
I see this kind of value
proposition all the time.
Saw you're hiring.
We see most CROs struggle because
they ignore this challenge.
We see, want to hear more.
Now we see emails like this because
we're often encouraged as sellers
to write short, short, short emails.
But again, I beg to differ here.
Longer is better, and here's why.
We have to convince our buyer that
time with us will be well spent.
When you state something specifically
that you can solve for them, then think.
What is the next big objection?
What is the buyer thinking
and what's their rebuttal?
You stating that you can solve a
challenge for them isn't enough.
You might get them to either object,
say we don't need that, we say we
already do that, something like that.
So we've got to get around
that objection to begin with.
Let's take a look at an example
that someone on the SAM sales
team might send to a prospect.
Let's say our value
proposition starts with this.
If you're anything like our
clients, you see your usage rates
of LinkedIn sales navigator hover
around 5 percent of your licenses.
We can train your teams
and bring that number up.
I also know that my most common
objection is we have a customer
success manager at LinkedIn.
We don't need this.
So if they said that to me, or
if they responded to me in that
way, what would I say back?
This is what I want to write
succinctly in the first email.
You likely have a customer success
manager at LinkedIn, but rather than
having them teach you what buttons
to push, our team will teach you how
to use this platform to sell in the
same way that she did when she was an
executive at LinkedIn for her teams.
So what that does, right,
for that buyer is, huh.
Oh, so maybe there is something not only
that Sam can do to improve our rates,
but to change how we use the platform.
And finally, what you thought would
never come, the end of the email.
How do we close it?
For starters, with any outbound email,
and I would tell you even referral emails
where you get introductions that are
inbound, do not use a calendar link.
Why don't we want to do this?
It's presumptuous, it's a little
rude, and it puts the onus on the
individual to schedule time with you.
Here's the other thing
that I don't like about it.
Now that individual is working
around your calendar instead
of you working around theirs.
Another thing to avoid is writing
something along the lines of, do you
have 15 to 20 minutes tomorrow to chat?
Or would Monday at 1 p.
m.
work?
Again, the reason for this is it's
presumptuous in terms of a short timeline
tomorrow or it gets too specific, and it
allows the buyer to say no to Monday at 1.
And then you're left in a
pattern of chasing them.
What I would tell you to do
instead is something that looks
different and that looks like this.
Simply say, do you have time over
the next week or two to learn more?
Let me know what works for you and I'll
send a calendar invite along accordingly.
Nobody sends scripting
that looks like that.
So not only will you be different,
but you'll take their timing and
their calendar into effect, allowing
you to schedule the call, You to
control the timing and even for
you to rearrange things on your
calendar to accommodate them.
I've just walked you through
beginning to end exactly how to
structure emails that will get
replies from high value prospects.
If you want to see a few examples that put
it all together, I encourage you to check
out the resources section of this course.
I also want to challenge you to
start putting this all into practice.
Set a goal for yourself.
Perhaps it's just 20 emails per week.
Remember, quality over quantity, but start
practicing these emails, writing with this
new script, following these new techniques
that I've taught you, and I promise you
will start seeing results immediately.
A couple of questions I frequently get
asked are, when should I send my emails?
And if I don't get a response,
if I put all that time into my
first email, then what do I do?
Now that I've taught you how to structure
emails, I want to give you a few pointers
on how to address exactly those things
and how to structure your sequences.
With the first email, here's
something unique that you can try.
Do all of your research during the
week, but don't send your emails
until Thursday or Friday, particularly
for high ranking executives.
The time of day doesn't typically matter,
but here's what I want you to think about.
What's going to happen when you send
that first show me you know me email
is you might capture their attention.
You might get a quick open, you might
get a quick read, but then something
comes up that's going to distract them.
So while your email made impact, perhaps
it didn't get an immediate reply.
So then what?
Data shows that you get a significant
increase not only in open rate, but
in response rate if you send the
second email less than 48 hours later.
A couple of tips here, again, the
opposite of what we most often see.
First and foremost, do not
change the subject line.
Second, when you send this
less than 48 hours, don't give
them a second novel to read.
You already killed it
with your first email.
So the second email is
just to say, Remember me?
I'd really love a response.
So what we want to put content wise
in that second email is very simple,
and you can use any variation of this.
We might say something like, Hey
Josh, wanted to quickly pop in and
see if you've read my below email.
It's still be grateful for the
chance to chat with you about how
Sam sales can support company name.
So to recap so far, day one is
going to be your first email
on a Thursday or a Friday.
Your second email, your second touch, is
going to come on a Saturday or a Sunday.
Now your third touch, or your
fourth touch, might come a couple
days after that, and then another
couple of days after that.
Don't forget, while there's a lot of data
that shows exactly what's perfect, we're
also dealing with human beings who have
different lives and different schedules
and are checking emails in different ways.
So don't be too afraid of the
timing of when the third and
the fourth and so on come.
I want you to think about the fourth
or the fifth touch, and that's usually
where the LinkedIn touch comes.
Now a couple of things to be careful of
when I talk about the LinkedIn touch.
First and foremost, a lot of people
have built into their sequence something
that's called the profile view.
I would tell you, cut this immediately
out of your sequence and here's why.
That executive might only
see the last five people who
have looked at their profile.
I promise you this doesn't impact your
open or your reply rate, so cut it out.
The second thing I would be
mindful of is do not use InMails.
This is something that was really popular
in the early days of LinkedIn, and it was
really effective because it was different.
But, we ruined InMails by making
them really spammy and really salesy.
So instead, create a LinkedIn connection.
You are going to go to the person's
profile, you're going to hit connect,
or you will hit the three dots to
personalize an invite, and And simply add
a script that looks something like this.
My name might look familiar
as I've sent you a few emails.
I would still be grateful or appreciative
of the chance to chat with you about how
SAM sales can support organization name.
If you were ever up for a
chat, please let me know.
One really cool thing about this
is this you're going to stand
out from the noise because you're
actually going to use content and
context in your connection request.
What many people do these
days is the opposite.
They send a blank connection request
and then they do something called the
pitch slap where the person accepts
the connection request and they
immediately pitch them in the DMS.
Don't do this.
When you are straightforward and
you add context to your connection
request, here's what happens.
You communicate with the person
that you've already tried the old
school ways to get their attention.
You might even send them
back to your emails to read.
But the other thing is they'll
be able to look at your profile.
They'll be able to humanize who you
are and they will most likely accept.
The great thing here is that sometimes
they want to book the meetings with
you, other times they simply say thanks
period, or nothing at all period.
This is your chance to be different.
Send a reply when you get the thanks or
the nothing in response, and simply say,
thank you so much for connecting with
me, I look forward to staying in touch.
You will delight and surprise your buyer
because you are doing something different
and you are not pitch slapping them.
Now, I could keep walking you through
the exact sequence we use at SAM
Sales, but the point is, I want to
make sure it's really clear that
you're not going to hit it out of
the park with the first sequence.
The whole idea is to A B test.
So create one, two, three sequences.
And take a look at what works is maybe
email three, getting the most responses.
Is it something about email eight
that ultimately gets people to click
on your marketing campaign or a link
that you included for a webinar?
What is it about that
messaging that works?
And then start to thread
those things together.
We're looking to create the ultimate
sequence, but we have to start
somewhere and we have to start testing.
Let's look at a couple of other
things that typically happen.
You might send a really great email
that all of a sudden gets a few opens.
Transcribed Perhaps one's in Texas,
perhaps something is in Detroit on a
mobile device, and it's all pretty quick.
That's what's called a trigger.
And you want to use those triggers
when you see these things happening in
succession and use them to your advantage.
Now, you might consider even using
a little self deprecating humor
when you reach back out to the
person that you reached out to.
I might say something like, Josh,
I see a few emails getting open
in a few different locations.
I imagine and I'm hopeful that
that means that there's intent by
you and your colleagues and you're
interested, or my email was really
bad and you guys are talking about it.
Make sure whatever you say is
authentic to you, but I think humor and
authenticity can often go a long way.
Another thing to think about is
you might also get objections.
Thank you so much for reaching out.
Now's not the right time.
I'm not the right buyer.
Please reach out to us in
90 days, things like that.
The thing that's wonderful about this
is because you put the time into Show
Me You Know Me, you will more often get
replies, even if now's not the right time.
And even if the person isn't the buyer,
this opens a door to communication.
You can connect on LinkedIn, you can
keep in touch with them, and certainly
if they say, we'd love to talk, just
not right now, this allows you to
start nurturing and investing in the
relationship versus just chasing them with
spammy and personalized at scale email.
The key to keep in mind is that because
you didn't use personalization at scale
and instead used show me, you know me,
you open the door to building better
and more authentic relationships in even
less time than you were doing before.
Sorry, I didn't see you there.
I was taking notes from Sam's course.
Anyway, um, while you're here, did
you know you can build sequences in
Apollo, just like the ones Sam taught?
It's actually really easy to do.
You can use a template or AI
to create a new sequence, or
just create one from scratch.
Then you can add all the touch points
Sam talked about as tasks, like manual
personalized emails, aka your show me
you know me emails, automatic follow up
emails, phone calls, and LinkedIn touches.
Apollo isn't just great for finding
leads, but for reaching out to them too.
And that's why they call it
the all in one sales platform.
Back to the course.
We've talked about doing your research,
writing that first email, building out
a sequence for if they don't respond,
but now let's get into what happens
when you actually do get a reply.
Now you've got the meeting booked.
What do we do when we show
up to that first call?
As I said, show me, you know, me bleeds
through every part of your sales cycle.
From the first email to when
you've had a client for 10 years.
So it's really important that you
do your pre call research just as
you do your research for an email.
When we think about the typical
opening script for a discovery
call, They're not great.
So here's what I want you to think about
as an opening script that you will hear
us use on almost every single discovery
call SAM Sales has with our prospects.
Here's how we start.
Thank you so much for
making time for us today.
I could tell you a million
things about SAM Sales.
One, two, and three.
In this little section, I
list three things that are
related to that buyer persona.
So I want to make sure that they're
specific to their interests, specific
to maybe things that they shared with
me in advance of what they'd like to
get out of the call, or things that
are specific to what I typically talk
about with that specific buyer persona.
So again, I could tell you a million
things about hashtag SamSales,
one, two, or three, but I would
love to hear about you first.
Now, this is where the show
me, you know me kicks in.
So you might say, I know you
recently had an acquisition.
I know you're looking to double revenue.
I recently saw that you replaced your CRO.
Whatever it is that you learned
about them and researched in
advance is what goes here.
And then you close it out with, tell
me about your team, your challenges,
what's the overall landscape
like for you, if that's okay.
I want you to think about
this in three parts.
You share a little bit about yourself.
You share what you know about them, and
then you give them some breathing room
to think about what they want to share
with you, while asking for permission
at the very end, if that's okay.
What is amazing about this opening
script is, first of all, it gets
so much information out of them.
Those buyers typically will
respond with a big sigh.
Yeah, so, and then they'll
start to talk for two or three
or nine minutes sometimes.
And what's fantastic about this
is while they're talking, they're
answering a lot of the questions
that you might have in the beginning.
So do they have budget?
What technologies do they use?
They might answer questions for you to
help you qualify the call before you've
ever even asked a second question.
The other thing that's fantastic
about this is the question does
not focus on features and benefits.
Which most of the calls do.
This allows you to elevate your game and
to ask questions about specific business
challenges versus just products and
features that they're looking to resolve.
What happens though, when we
meet somebody in person, right?
Not all meetings are happening
digitally these days.
So let's say somebody says,
I'd love to meet you for
coffee, for lunch, for drinks.
What do you do that might be
different in your preparation?
If you are booking the lunch, drinks, or
the coffee date, I would make sure that
you make the reservation if you can.
I once met a CEO for lunch, and
when I went, I was unfortunately the
latter of the person to get there.
They showed up early, and I was
seated with my back to the restaurant.
Now, what that meant is while the
person kept talking and talking and
talking, and I really needed to go, I
was left in a position of continuing to
make small talk, While looking around
and trying to find the waiter, it was
really awkward, I had to keep doing
it, and I vowed to never do it again.
So here are my tips.
One, make the reservation.
Two, add notes in the reservation
details that say specifically when
you would like the check to be
brought, and to be brought to you.
And third, make sure you show up early.
Little things like this can make sure
that it goes really smoothly, particularly
if this is the first or second time
you're taking a meeting in person.
These are relationships you
will hopefully keep for life.
As people transition jobs, they tend to
stay within the same vertical and you
probably will too, which means you will
have these clients as they transition
from one leadership position to another,
from that very first email to how you
talk to them on the phone, to how you
present yourself in person, I challenge
you to set yourself at an infinitely
higher bar by showing your buyers that
you know them and by going the extra mile.
By focusing on quality over quantity,
you're building an elite career as a
seller, as someone who is different.
Your open and reply rates will skyrocket,
you'll make more sales in the end,
and you'll get financial freedom.
There is really no downside
to making this effort.
Remember to set a goal
for yourself, right now.
Decide how many Show Me, You Know
Me focused emails you want to send
this week, and don't worry about
how long you're spending on them.
I promise the time will come down
as you build this muscle, and
you might be surprised at who you
hear back from and how quickly.
