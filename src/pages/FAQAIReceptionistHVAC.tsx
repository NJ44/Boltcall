      question: 'How does the AI handle HVAC-specific terminology?',
      answer:
        'The AI is trained on industry terminology including system types (split, packaged, mini-split, heat pump), common issues (compressor failure, refrigerant leak, blower motor), brand names (Carrier, Trane, Lennox, Goodman), and SEER ratings. It understands callers describing symptoms in plain language and maps them to the correct service categories.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can the AI dispatch technicians directly?',
      answer:
        'Yes, when integrated with your field service software. The AI checks which technicians are available, considers their current location and skill set, and assigns the job. For emergencies, it can notify the nearest on-call tech via text and phone simultaneously, reducing response times from hours to minutes.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can the AI upsell maintenance agreements?',
      answer:
        'Yes. When a caller books a repair, the AI can mention your maintenance plan as a cost-saving option. For example, after scheduling an AC repair, it might say: "We also offer a maintenance plan that includes two annual tune-ups and priority scheduling. Would you like details?" This passive upsell approach consistently converts 8-15% of repair callers.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does an AI receptionist compare to voicemail for HVAC?',
      answer:
        'Voicemail loses 60-80% of HVAC callers because homeowners with a broken AC or furnace will not wait for a callback. They call the next company. An AI receptionist answers instantly, gathers the issue details, and either books the appointment or dispatches a tech on the spot. The result is dramatically higher lead capture and faster response times.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do homeowners actually like talking to an AI receptionist?',
      answer:
        'Most callers cannot tell they are speaking with AI. Modern AI receptionists use natural-sounding voices and handle conversational flow including interruptions. Homeowners consistently report higher satisfaction because they get an immediate answer instead of hold music or voicemail. If a caller requests a human, the AI transfers to your staff seamlessly.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does the AI handle seasonal volume scaling?',
      answer:
        'The AI scales automatically with no configuration changes needed. Whether you receive 10 calls a day in spring or 80 calls a day during a summer heat wave, every call is answered on the first ring. There are no per-call charges, so your cost stays flat even when volume spikes. This eliminates the need to hire and train temporary seasonal staff.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can the AI transfer calls to live HVAC staff?',
      answer:
        'Yes. You define the transfer rules: specific question types, VIP customers, or any caller who requests a human. The AI provides a warm handoff, briefing your staff on the caller\'s name, issue, and system details before connecting. This saves your team from repeating intake questions and speeds up resolution.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What kind of monthly reporting does the AI provide?',
      answer:
        'You receive detailed analytics including total calls handled, calls by time of day and day of week, appointments booked, emergency dispatches, average call duration, and top caller questions. This data reveals staffing gaps, peak demand windows, and which marketing channels drive the most calls.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the cancellation policy for an AI receptionist?',
      answer:
        'Most providers, including Boltcall, offer month-to-month plans with no long-term contracts. You can cancel anytime without penalties or termination fees. Your call data and recordings remain accessible for download after cancellation, so you never lose historical information.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does the AI protect my HVAC customer data?',
      answer:
        'Reputable AI receptionist providers use bank-level encryption (AES-256) for data at rest and TLS 1.3 for data in transit. Call recordings and customer information are stored on SOC 2 compliant servers. Access is restricted to authorized users only, and you can delete customer data at any time to comply with privacy regulations.',

                  <li>• Answers every call instantly during summer and winter peak seasons — no busy signals</li>

                  <li>• Integration with niche field-service platforms may require custom webhook work</li>
                  <li>• AI cannot physically assess equipment condition or provide repair estimates on-site</li>
