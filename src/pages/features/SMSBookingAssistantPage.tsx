                SMS Booking Assistant enables your customers to book, reschedule, and manage appointments 
                entirely through text messages. No phone calls, no website visits, no apps—just simple, 
                convenient SMS conversations that work on any phone, regardless of the device or carrier.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg">
                Your AI assistant handles availability checks, confirms appointments, sends reminders, 
                and manages cancellations—all through natural text conversations that feel like texting a friend. 
                The system understands natural language, so customers can express their preferences in their own words, 
                and the AI will interpret and respond appropriately.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg">
                The booking process is seamless and intuitive. Customers simply text your business number, 
                and the AI guides them through the booking process step by step. It can check your calendar 
                availability in real-time, suggest optimal appointment times, handle rescheduling requests, 
                and even manage cancellations—all automatically.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg">
                This SMS-based approach eliminates the friction of traditional booking methods. Customers 
                don't need to download apps, navigate websites, or wait on hold. They can book appointments 
                from anywhere, at any time, using the communication method they're most comfortable with.

                  <strong>98% of text messages are opened</strong>, compared to just 20% of emails. 
                  Customers prefer SMS for quick, convenient communication. By offering SMS booking, 
                  you're meeting customers where they already are.

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-3">
                  SMS has become the preferred communication channel for many customers because it's immediate, 
                  personal, and doesn't require internet connectivity. Unlike emails that can get lost in spam 
                  folders or apps that require downloads, SMS works on every phone and gets immediate attention. 
                  This high engagement rate means your booking messages are more likely to be seen and acted upon.

                  SMS reminders have a <strong>45% higher response rate</strong> than phone calls or emails. 
                  Automated SMS reminders significantly reduce no-shows, protecting your revenue and

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-3">
                  No-shows cost businesses thousands of dollars annually in lost revenue and wasted time. 
                  SMS reminders sent 24 hours and 2 hours before appointments dramatically reduce no-show rates 
                  by keeping appointments top-of-mind for customers. The convenience of SMS also makes it easy 
                  for customers to confirm, reschedule, or cancel if needed, reducing last-minute cancellations.

                  Eliminate back-and-forth phone calls and emails. Customers can book in seconds via text,

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-3">
                  Traditional booking methods require multiple touchpoints: phone calls, emails, calendar checks, 
                  and confirmations. Each interaction takes time and creates opportunities for errors or miscommunication. 
                  SMS booking streamlines this entire process into a single, automated conversation that handles 
                  everything from initial inquiry to final confirmation, freeing up your staff to focus on delivering 
                  excellent service rather than managing schedules.

                  Customers can book appointments anytime, even when your business is closed. 
                  No more missed opportunities due to limited hours. This 24/7 availability means 
                  you capture bookings from customers who research and make decisions outside of 
                  traditional business hours.

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-3">
                  Many customers prefer to book appointments during evenings, weekends, or other times 
                  when they're not at work. By offering SMS booking that works around the clock, you 
                  never miss an opportunity to capture a booking, regardless of when the customer decides 
                  to reach out.

                  Send immediate booking confirmations via SMS. Customers get instant peace of mind,

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-3">
                  Instant confirmations are crucial for customer satisfaction. When customers book an

                  Reduce no-shows with automated SMS reminders sent before appointments. 
                  Customers can confirm, reschedule, or cancel with a simple text reply. This

                  Automated reminders serve multiple purposes: they keep appointments top-of-mind, 
                  allow customers to easily reschedule if needed, and provide an opportunity to 
                  confirm attendance. The ability to reschedule via text reduces last-minute cancellations

                  A customer sends a text message to your business number requesting an appointment. 
                  They can use natural language like "I need an appointment next week" or "Can I book 
                  for Tuesday afternoon?" The AI understands the intent and responds immediately,

                  The AI checks your calendar in real-time to find available time slots that match 
                  the customer's preferences. It considers your business hours, existing appointments, 
                  blocked time, and any scheduling rules you've set (like buffer times between appointments). 
                  The system presents available options in a conversational, easy-to-understand format.

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-3">
                  If the customer's preferred time isn't available, the AI suggests alternative times

                  Once the customer selects a time, the AI confirms the appointment details, including 
                  date, time, location, and any special instructions. The confirmation message is clear 
                  and comprehensive, ensuring the customer has all the information they need. The 
                  appointment is immediately added to your calendar, and you receive a notification.

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-3">
                  The confirmation can include additional helpful information like directions to your 
                  location, what to bring, preparation requirements, or cancellation policies. This 
                  upfront information reduces confusion and helps ensure customers are prepared for 
                  their appointment, improving the overall experience.

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  The system automatically sends reminder messages before the appointment—typically 
                  24 hours and 2 hours before. These reminders include appointment details and easy 
                  options to confirm, reschedule, or cancel. This reduces no-shows and gives you 
                  advance notice if someone needs to reschedule.

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-3">
                  If a customer needs to reschedule, they can simply reply to the reminder text with 
                  their new preferred time. The AI handles the rescheduling automatically, finding 
                  alternative times and updating the calendar. This convenience encourages customers to 
                  reschedule rather than simply not showing up, protecting your schedule and revenue.

                  Customers can manage their appointments anytime via text. They can reschedule, cancel, 
                  or ask questions about their upcoming appointment. The AI handles all these interactions 
                  automatically, freeing you from administrative tasks while providing customers with 
                  convenient self-service options.

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-3">
                  The system maintains a complete history of all text conversations and appointment

                  A medical practice implemented SMS booking to reduce phone call volume and improve 
                  patient convenience. Patients can now text to book appointments, receive reminders, 
                  and reschedule if needed—all without calling the office. This reduced phone call volume 
                  by 60%, allowing staff to focus on in-person patient care.

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  The practice saw a 30% reduction in no-shows thanks to automated reminders and easy 
                  rescheduling options. Patients appreciate the convenience of texting, especially for 
                  routine appointments. The system can also handle appointment types, insurance 
                  verification questions, and preparation instructions, making the entire process smoother.

                  appointments. The system handles different service types (haircuts, color, treatments)

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  The salon increased bookings by 40% because customers could book anytime, even when the
