    q: 'What is speed to lead?',
    a: 'Speed to lead is the elapsed time between a prospect submitting an inquiry and receiving their first response from your business. It is measured in minutes or hours. Research consistently shows that businesses responding within 5 minutes convert significantly more leads than those responding hours or days later.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How fast should a local business respond to a lead?',
    a: 'The target response time for local businesses is 5 minutes or less. MIT research found that responding within 5 minutes makes you 100x more likely to reach a lead than responding after 30 minutes. After 10 minutes, your odds of a meaningful conversation drop by 400%.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What happens if you respond to leads too slowly?',
    a: 'Slow response causes three compounding losses: the lead goes to a competitor who responded first, the potential lifetime value of that customer is lost, and your marketing spend on generating that lead is wasted. Studies show 78% of buyers choose the business that responds first.',

    q: 'What is a good speed-to-lead benchmark by industry?',
    a: 'Industry benchmarks vary: HVAC and plumbing emergency calls should be answered within 2 minutes. Dental new patient inquiries within 10 minutes. Legal consultations within 30 minutes. Med spa bookings within 5 minutes. The common thread: the first business to respond wins in every industry.',

    a: 'AI receptionists respond instantly, 24/7, without lunch breaks, sick days, or peak-season overflow. When a lead comes in at 11pm on a Sunday, an AI system responds in under 10 seconds while human staff are unavailable. This eliminates the #1 reason local businesses lose leads: nobody answered.',

            Speed to lead (also called lead response time) is the elapsed time between a prospect submitting an inquiry — a phone call, web form, SMS, or chat message — and your business making first contact with them.
