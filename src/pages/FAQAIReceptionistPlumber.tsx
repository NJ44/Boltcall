Full customization with emergency triage rules, service type definitions, dispatch protocols, and pricing ranges takes 1-2 hours.

    },
    {
      question: 'Can the AI triage emergency plumbing calls like burst pipes?',
      answer:
        'Yes. The AI asks targeted questions to classify urgency. A burst pipe with active flooding triggers immediate dispatch to your on-call plumber with the caller\'s name, address, and situation details sent via text and phone. A dripping faucet or slow drain is booked for the next available routine slot. This triage prevents false emergencies from disrupting your team while ensuring real emergencies get an instant response.',

    },
    {
      question: 'Can the AI validate whether a caller is in our service area?',
      answer:
        'Yes. The AI asks for the caller\'s zip code or street address and checks it against your defined service area boundaries. Callers inside your zone get booked immediately. Callers outside your coverage receive a polite explanation. This prevents wasted dispatch trips to locations 45 minutes away and keeps your plumbers productive in high-density areas.',

    {
      question: 'Does the AI schedule around plumber availability and location?',

It books appointments into open slots that minimize drive time between jobs, improving daily job capacity by 15-20% compared to a dispatcher manually juggling a paper calendar.',

    {
      question: 'Can the AI handle calls for multiple plumbing service types?',

        'Yes. The AI distinguishes between drain cleaning, water heater repair and installation, leak detection, pipe repair and repiping, sewer line work, fixture installation, water treatment systems, and any other service you offer. It asks the right qualifying questions for each type and books the appropriate appointment duration with the correct technician.',

It can also trigger automated review requests after completed jobs, helping your plumbing company build a stronger online reputation on Google, Yelp, and Angi.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can the AI automate review collection for my plumbing business?',
      answer:
        'Yes. After a job is marked complete, the AI sends an automated text with a direct link to your Google Business Profile review page. Satisfied customers can leave a review in two taps. Plumbing companies using automated review requests see a 3-5x increase in monthly reviews, which directly improves local search rankings and booking volume.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does the AI handle seasonal demand spikes for plumbing?',
      answer:
        'The AI scales to unlimited simultaneous calls with no degradation. During winter freeze season when burst pipe calls spike 300-400%, every caller still gets an immediate answer. During summer water heater season, no one hits voicemail while your team is on the truck. Your cost stays flat regardless of volume, unlike answering services that charge per call.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does an AI receptionist compare to a traditional answering service for plumbers?',
      answer:
        'Traditional answering services cost $1-2 per call with human operators who read from scripts, frequently misspell names, and cannot book appointments in your system. An AI receptionist costs a flat $99-249 per month, handles unlimited calls, books directly into your calendar, triages emergencies with consistent accuracy, and sends confirmation texts automatically.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What ROI can a plumbing company expect from an AI receptionist?',
      answer:
        'Most plumbing companies see a 4-8x return in the first month. The average plumbing service call is worth $250-450, and emergency jobs run $500-1,500. Capturing just 3-4 calls per week that previously went to voicemail or a competitor pays for the entire year of AI service. After-hours emergency capture alone often covers the monthly cost twice over.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Does the AI receptionist support multiple languages for plumbing calls?',
      answer:
        'Yes. The AI detects the caller\'s language and responds automatically in Spanish, French, Portuguese, and other supported languages. For plumbing companies serving diverse communities, this eliminates the language barrier that causes homeowners to hang up and call a competitor who speaks their language.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Does the AI record plumbing service calls?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Every call is recorded and transcribed automatically. You can search transcripts by keyword to find specific conversations, review how the AI handled a disputed call, or analyze patterns in customer complaints. Recordings are stored securely on encrypted servers and accessible through your dashboard anytime.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can the AI transfer calls to an on-call plumber?',
      answer:
        'Yes. For confirmed emergencies, the AI immediately calls your on-call plumber and connects both parties with a warm handoff. The plumber receives a text with the caller\'s name, address, phone number, and a summary of the issue before the call connects. This gives your tech full context so they can prepare equipment and provide an accurate ETA.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does the AI protect my plumbing company\'s customer data?',
      answer:
        'Customer data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 and in transit using TLS 1.3. Infrastructure is hosted on SOC 2 Type II compliant servers with regular security audits. Access is restricted to authorized users with multi-factor authentication. You own all your data and can export or delete it at any time.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What monthly reporting does the AI provide for plumbing companies?',
      answer:
        'You receive detailed analytics including total calls handled, calls by hour and day of week, jobs booked by service type, emergency dispatch count, average call duration, conversion rate from call to booking, and top caller questions. This data reveals your peak call windows, most-requested services, and marketing channel performance.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the cancellation policy for a plumbing AI receptionist?',
      answer:
        'Most providers, including Boltcall, offer month-to-month plans with no long-term contracts or cancellation fees. You can cancel anytime with no penalties. Your call recordings, transcripts, and customer data remain available for download after cancellation so you never lose historical information.',
